# Heart Disease Prediction
## Introduction
Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related features. The dataset includes factors such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The primary goal is to leverage logistic regression to create a predictive model for identifying potential cases of heart disease.

## Objectives
Data Exploration:

Visualize the dataset to understand feature distributions.
Analyze correlations between health factors and heart disease.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and normalize features.

Model Training:
Use logistic regression for binary classification.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Evaluation:
Assess accuracy on training and testing datasets.
Visualize predictions and compare with actual outcomes.

## Methods Used
Logistic Regression: Chosen for simplicity and interpretability in binary classification.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights into dataset structure.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned by handling missing values and normalizing features.
Model Training and Evaluation: Logistic regression trained and evaluated for accuracy.

## Results
The logistic regression model achieved satisfactory accuracy on training and testing datasets. Predictions were compared with actual outcomes using a confusion matrix.

## Conclusion
This project applies logistic regression for medical diagnosis, contributing to predictive healthcare analytics. Future work may explore additional features or models for optimization.
